## Installation
To install the truenet tool do the following:
1. Clone the git repository into your local directory.
  - If you are not familiar with GitHub then the easiest way is to use the button labelled **<> Code** (right hand side, just above the file list) on the [main truenet page](/) and select the **Download ZIP** option. After you've done this, move the zip file to where you want to have truenet installed and unzip it.
3. Open up a terminal, go to the directory created when you unzipped the file, and then run:
```
python setup.py install
```
3. Use the instructions in this document ([simple usage](#simple-usage) is recommended for beginners)
4. For more advanced usage, detailed lists of options for the subcommands are available in the command-line help:
```
truenet --help
```
And for options and inputs for each sub-command, type:
```
truenet <subcommand> --help (e.g. truenet train --help)
```

---
---

## Preprocessing and preparing data for truenet
T1-weighted and/or FLAIR images, or similar (e.g. T2-weighted images), can be used as inputs for truenet. A series of preprocessing operations needs to be applied to any image that you want to use truenet on. A script for performing these preprocessing steps has been provided: _prepare_truenet_data_

This script performs the following steps:
 - reorienting image to the standard MNI space (using FSL FLIRT)
 - skull-stripping (using FSL BET)
 - bias field correction (using FSL FAST)
 - T1-weighted images (or similar) need to be registered to the FLAIR (or whatever image was used to make the manual masks) using linear rigid-body registration (using FSL FLIRT).
 - creating a white matter mask, obtained from a dilated and inverted cortical CSF tissue segmentation (combined with other deep grey exclusion masks, using FSL FAST) and the _make bianca mask_ command in FSL BIANCA (Griffanti et al., 2016).

### prepare_truenet_data
```
Usage: prepare_truenet_data <FLAIR_image_name> <T1_image_name> <output_basename>

The script prepares the FLAIR and T1 data to be used in FSL truenet with a specified output basename
FLAIR_image_name: name of the input unprocessed FLAIR image
T1_image_name: name of the input unprocessed T1 image
output_basename: name to be used for the processed FLAIR and T1 images (along with the absolute path);

output names are: output_basename_FLAIR.nii.gz, output_basename_T1.nii.gz and output_basename_WMmask.nii.gz will be saved
```
**Example:**

`prepare_truenet_data FLAIR.nii.gz T1.nii.gz sub001`

## Simple usage

### Modes

There are multiple options in how truenet can be used, but a simple summary is this:
 - to segment an image you use the _evaluate_ mode
 - this requires an existing _model_ to be used, where a model is a deep learning network (which is what is inside truenet) that has been trained on some dataset
 - you can use a _pretrained_ model that is supplied with truenet (see [below](#pretrained-models))
   - to use any of these pretrained models, your images need to match relatively well to those used to train the model
 - alternatively, you can use a model that you or someone else has trained from scratch (using the _train_ mode of truenet)
 - another alternative is to take a pretrained model and _fine tune_ this on your data, which is more efficient than training from scratch (that is, it requires less of your own labelled data for training)

### Recommendations

To begin with we recommend that you try one of the pretrained models that is supplied with truenet (see [below](#pretrained-models)).  If you find that this doesn't work as well as you would like then try fine tuning one of the pretrained models.  If that still doesn't work well then try training from scratch.

Note that one reason that things might not work well is if the preprocessing fails, so make sure you check the preprocessing results before running trunet (looking at the images in _fsleyes_ is normally the best way to check if the registrations, brain extractions and bias field corrections are good or not).

The simplest way to choose which pretrained model to choose is just by looking at example images from those datasets (see [WMH challenge](https://wmh.isi.uu.nl/) and [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/about-our-data)) and deciding which ones look closer to yours or not.  One of the reasons that different models are needed is that images vary between different MRI sequences and scanners.  Sometimes the differences are obvious to the eye and sometimes not, and deep learning networks can sometimes be sensitive to subtle differences.  If you are not sure which is closest then pick one and try it, and then try the other one if you are not happy.

When performing a fine tuning operation it is necessary to supply your own labelled images (i.e. images and manual segmentations) and for this to work we recommend that you have at least 14 images (though you can try with less and see if you are lucky). Typically, the more you have the better your chances of it adapting well to the characteristics of your images and/or the specifics of your segmentation protocol/preferences. Normally we would recommend trying fine tuning before training from scratch (and the latter isn't needed if your fine tuning results are good) but the one exception to this is when your images are obviously very different to those in the pretrained datasets, as in this case you are unlikely to get a good result from fine tuning.

When performing a training from scratch, the situation is similar to that for fine tuning - you need a set of your own labelled images, but you need more in this case and we would recommend a minimum of 25 images (though again, you can try your luck with less).

### Naming conventions

When running truenet it is necessary to use certain specific names and locations for files:
 - for segmentation (_evaluate_ mode) the images inside the specified input directory need to be named like the outputs from _prepare_truenet_data_ :
   - that is: the FLAIR and/or T1 volumes should be named as *basename*_FLAIR.nii.gz and/or *basename*_T1.nii.gz respectively
 - each output directory that is specified must already exist; if not, use _mkdir_ to create it prior to running truenet
 - for training or fine-tuning, all images need to be in one directory and named:
   - preprocessed images: *subject*_FLAIR.nii.gz and/or *subject*_T1.nii.gz
   - labelled images: (i.e. manual segmentations) need to be named *subject*_manualmask.nii.gz
   - where the *subject* part needs to be replaced with your subject identifier (e.g. sub-001)
  
The overall naming conventions are shown in the table below:
| File | Naming format  |
| :-----: | :---: |
| Preprocessed Input FLAIR | <subject_name>_FLAIR.nii.gz| 
| Preprocessed Input T1 | <subject_name>_T1.nii.gz| 
| Preprocessed Input GM distance map | <subject_name>_GMdistmap.nii.gz| 
| Preprocessed Input Ventricle distance map | <subject_name>_ventdistmap.nii.gz| 
| Manual mask | <subject_name>_manualmask.nii.gz| 

### Pretrained models

Names of arguments for -m for various pretrained models are given in the table below:
| Model | Pretrained on | Naming format |
| :-----: | :---: | :---: |
| Single channel, FLAIR only | MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge Data | mwsc_flair| 
| Single channel, T1 only | MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge Data | mwsc_t1| 
| Two channels, FLAIR and T1 | MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge Data | mwsc| 
| Single channel, FLAIR only | UK Biobank dataset | ukbb_flair| 
| Single channel, T1 only |UK Biobank dataset | ukbb_t1| 
| Single channel, FLAIR and T1 | UK Biobank dataset | ukbb | 

#### Pretrained model recommendations:

 - It is highly recommended to use both modalities (FLAIR and T1) as a two channel input if it is possible. 
 - If only one modality is used then FLAIR usually gives better results than just T1 (and use mwsc_flair or ukbb_flair for FLAIR alone).
 - mwsc models are ideal for fine-tuning on small datasets (<20 subjects) while ukbb models are better for larger ones.

**_IMPORTANT NOTE:_**  

Currently pretrained models, based on the [MWSC](https://wmh.isi.uu.nl/) (MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge) and [UKBB](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/about-our-data) (UK Biobank) datasets, are available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iqO-hd27NSHHfKun125Rt-2fh1l9EiuT?usp=share_link. These will be integrated more fully into FSL in the future, where these models will be available in the '$FSLDIR/data/truenet/models' folder. Currently, for testing purposes, you can download the models from the above drive link and place them into a folder of your choice. You then need to set the folder as an environment variable before running truenet.
To do this, once you download the models into a folder, please type the following in the command prompt:
```
export TRUENET_PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH="/absolute/path/to/the/model/folder"
```
where you should replace _/absolute/path/to/the/model/folder_ with the path to the folder that contains the _*.pth_ files.  Then you can run truenet commands using the pretrained models as if they were integrated into FSL. The above export command needs to be done once for each terminal that you open, prior to running truenet.

### Examples

 - Using a pretrained model, run a segmentation on preprocessed data (from subject 1 in dataset A, stored in directory DatasetA/sub001 and containing files names sub001_T1.nii.gz and sub001_FLAIR.nii.gz, as created by `prepare_truenet_data`).

`mkdir DatasetA/results001`

`truenet evaluate -i DatasetA/sub001 -m mwsc -o DatasetA/results001`

---

 - Fine-tune an existing model using images and labels in the same directory (named sub001_FLAIR.nii.gz, sub001_T1.nii.gz and sub001_manualmask.nii.gz, sub002_FLAIR.nii.gz, sub002_T1.nii.gz, sub002_manualmask.nii.gz, etc.):

`mkdir DatasetA/model_finetuned`

`truenet fine_tune -i DatasetA/Training-partial -m mwsc -o DatasetA/model_finetuned -l DatasetA/Training-partial -loss weighted`

  - then apply this model to a new subject:

`truenet evaluate -i DatasetA/newsub -m DatasetA/model_finetuned/Truenet_model_weights_beforeES -o DatasetA/newresults`

---

 - Training a model from scratch using images and labels in the same directory (named sub001_FLAIR.nii.gz, sub001_T1.nii.gz and sub001_manualmask.nii.gz, sub002_FLAIR.nii.gz, sub002_T1.nii.gz, sub002_manualmask.nii.gz, etc.):

`mkdir DatasetA/model`

`truenet train -i DatasetA/Training-full -l DatasetA/Training-full -m DatasetA/model -loss weighted`

 - then apply this model to a new subject:

`truenet evaluate -i DatasetA/newsub -m DatasetA/model/Truenet_model_weights_beforeES -o DatasetA/newresults`

### Applying spatial weights in the loss function:
We used a weighted sum of the voxel-wise cross-entropy loss function and the Dice loss as the total cost function. We weighted the CE loss function using a spatial weight map (a sample shown in the figure) to up-weight the areas that are more likely to contain the less represented class (i.e. WMHs).
